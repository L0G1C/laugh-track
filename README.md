## Manual Installation
1. Create a folder named 'laugh-track' where your FoundryVTT loads its modules from (default is `{userData}/Data/modules`).
2. Download and extract this repo's source code into the 'laugh-track' folder.

## Features
Often times players have microphones muted or are using "push-to-talk", and when something entertaining or funny happens, all of their laughter is silent to the other table members. 

Laugh track seeks to resolve this problem by giving players a new option under the scene control options which allows the player to "send a laugh" to all other players at the table. There are a few options for style of laugh to send. And an option to set a new default sound which can be sent with a hotkey press of the "L" key on the keyboard.
